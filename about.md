Hello, I'm Didik Setiawan, and welcome to my DevOps blog. Here, I'm excited to share my journey, insights, and knowledge as a seasoned DevOps engineer with a strong passion for free and open-source software (FOSS) and collaboration. This blog is not only a platform for sharing what I've learned but also a digital journal where I document my experiences and observations in the dynamic realm of DevOps, automation, infrastructure as code, and the vibrant FOSS community.

### Who Am I?

I'm a dedicated DevOps enthusiast with years of experience in software development and IT operations. My career has provided me with the privilege of collaborating with diverse teams and organizations, helping them bridge the gap between development and operations to deliver high-quality software with greater speed and efficiency. My profound enthusiasm for FOSS and collaboration has significantly influenced my career choices and driven me to contribute actively to these communities.

### Why DevOps and FOSS?

My fascination with DevOps stems from its transformative potential in today's fast-paced software development landscape. DevOps transcends mere tools and practices; it embodies a cultural shift that empowers teams to work harmoniously, automate repetitive tasks, and continually enhance their processes. My commitment to FOSS is rooted in the belief that software should be open, transparent, and accessible to all. I see FOSS as a catalyst for innovation, user empowerment, and global collaboration.
